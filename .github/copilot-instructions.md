This project uses Vite + React + TypeScript, React-Aria, Supabase, React Query, React Router v6, and Sass with CSS Modules. All components should use .module.scss for styling. Use React Query for all data fetching and live updates. Use Supabase for authentication, PostgreSQL, and real-time subscriptions. Use React-Aria for all interactive components and accessibility primitives (e.g., useButton, useLink, useDialog, useOverlay, useModal, FocusScope, OverlayContainer). All code should be accessible and type-safe, and all interactive elements must use React-Aria hooks/components for accessibility. All styling (including layout, spacing, and colors) must be in SCSS files, not inline or in JS/TSX using the BEM naming convention.
